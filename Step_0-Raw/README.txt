All Covid data is read from 
https://github.com/sociedatos/covid19-bo-casos_por_departamento
which contains 7 different csv files for each bolivian department. 
Data is not saved as is but will be directly parsed and transformed in Step 1 folder.

The departamentos_Bolivia.geojson is a json file used for maps in the streamlit app.
